  <shortdesc>The individual rate schedule items (including any custom items) that were use/consumed during the performance of this Work Order. Where Completed Work Elements are listed, the Bill Of Material Items should *not* duplicate the Rate Schedule Items in the Complete Work Elements. Rather, only Rate Schedule Items that are *not* already included in a Completed Work Element should be included here.</shortdesc>
