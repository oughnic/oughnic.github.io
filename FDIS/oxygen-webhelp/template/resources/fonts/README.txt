To complete the font replacement:
1. Download "Lato" font (Regular and Bold) from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato (or other source).
2. Rename the files to:
   - Lato-Regular.ttf
   - Lato-Bold.ttf
3. Place them in this directory.

Georgia is a system font and does not typically require a file download.
